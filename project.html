<h2 ALIGN="CENTER">What is BuyTime.com?</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">BuyTime.com is an online collection of time:
every hour, minute, and second of the past has been collected by our professional staff, and now, 
for the first time ever, our collection of time is being sold to the public.
On Buytime.com, you can either pay a sum of money to have time added on to your life,
or you can trade valuable hours of your life for money.
Here at BuyTime.com, our motto is: "We've got the keys of time.
Come and take them from us!"

<br>
<h2 ALIGN="CENTER">Why use BuyTime.com?</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">You've wasted your life.  You had ambition, but gradually,
a mind-numbing, dead-end job helped burn that away.  You're running out of time!What's the solution? Buy some more!
That's right! Just imagine it:
An extra two weeks to get that Twitter Bootstrap project done,
an extra two months to get in shape,
or an extra two years to spend with your family before you die!
Buy our time! It's not inferior time.  It's good, quality time:
Summer Evenings, Eventful Mornings, Classic Winters.
We own the time of your life!</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 ALIGN="CENTER">How much does Time cost?</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">We're selling 3 hours for $25,
but the price of buying is $50.
That's $25 for the time, and an additional $50 for the buying of it.
But that's not all! You'll also need to pay a one-time fee
of $100 for us to accept the transaction, with a $90 booking fee,
plus postage and packing, which varies with the cost of inflation.
Also, our trained professionals are here to give you counseling
to determine whether our product is right for you,
at the price of an additional $88.92.
You'd have to be stupid to not take advantage of this wonderful deal!
